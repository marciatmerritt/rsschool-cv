## Cover Letter

Hello,

I’m Marcia Merritt, a software engineer with over 12 years of experience and a solid foundation in both modern and legacy technologies. My background spans a range of programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Jest, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and XML, as well as extensive experience in mainframe systems and COBOL. I’m also skilled in frameworks like React and tools such as Git, Docker, and VS Code.

Recently, I completed Midlands Tech’s Full Stack Software Engineering certificate, which deepened my expertise in modern web technologies and fueled my passion for building efficient, user-friendly applications. I’m currently expanding my back-end knowledge through RS School's Node.js course and look forward to starting their JavaScript Front-End course in October.

In addition to my technical skills, my volunteer work as a coding instructor at Code2College, my service at an animal shelter, and my experience as a sports official have all honed my adaptability, leadership, and commitment to inclusivity and effective communication in collaborative environments.

Outside of work, I enjoy a variety of activities—from caring for my pets to playing sports, working out, and practicing Bikram Yoga. These pursuits help me maintain balance and foster creativity, which I bring into my professional work.

I’m excited about the opportunity to leverage my unique combination of technical skills and collaborative mindset on projects that make a meaningful impact.

Best regards,  
**Marcia T. Merritt**
